# About the project

"Shapes" revolutionizes the study and interaction with geometric shapes by offering a unique and intuitive approach to learning. Users can easily identify shapes by simply entering the number of sides, providing an instant and accurate name for the shape. Conversely, users can input a shape's name to reveal its corresponding number of sides, enhancing their understanding of shape properties and classifications.

Beyond shape identification, "Shapes" provides a dynamic platform for exploring geometry through area calculations. Users can input the dimensions of various shapes, and the tool calculates the area, offering a practical and hands-on way to comprehend geometric concepts. Additionally, the tool allows users to interactively manipulate angles, providing a visual representation of angle properties and relationships.

The interactive nature of "Shapes" makes learning geometry engaging and immersive. Whether for educational purposes or personal exploration, users can benefit from a platform that not only educates but also encourages curiosity and discovery. "Shapes" is not just a tool for learning geometry; it is a gateway to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world of shapes and angles.
